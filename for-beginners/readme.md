in general it's not worth it as it uses minikube

dev-portal ine is much more in depth
sections of the course
- introduction
- overview 
- miniube installation
- kubernetes cluster
- pod creation
- deployment creation
- service creation
- deployment and service deletion
- running node application with k8s - did some of this
- rolling updates and pods recovery
- k8s dashboard
- yaml spec - that's quite deeply covered in the dev-portal course
- multiple deployments creation - idk?
- interaction between deployments
